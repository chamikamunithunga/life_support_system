## Overview

The Life Support System Monitoring program simulates a life support system for space missions. It monitors critical parameters such as oxygen levels, water recycling, and temperature control while providing real-time health monitoring for crew members. The application utilizes machine learning for predictive maintenance and anomaly detection, ensuring crew safety and system reliability.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors oxygen levels, water recycling, temperature, and crew health metrics.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Utilizes the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies in system data.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Employs linear regression to predict future temperature based on current oxygen and water levels.
- **Biometric Monitoring**: Simulates and records the health metrics of crew members, including heart rate and oxygen saturation.
- **AI Health Assistance**: Provides health recommendations based on crew health data.
- **Emergency Protocols**: Automatically activates emergency protocols when critical thresholds are breached.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for development.
- **Numpy**: A library for numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library for predictive modeling and anomaly detection.
