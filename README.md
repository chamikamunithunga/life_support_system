## Overview
This project simulates a life support system for a space environment, monitoring critical parameters such as oxygen levels, water recycling, and temperature control. It integrates machine learning models for predictive maintenance and anomaly detection, as well as biometric monitoring of crew members' health.

## Features
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously tracks oxygen levels, water recycling, and temperature.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Uses machine learning to predict future temperature based on historical data.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies anomalies in system data using Isolation Forest.
- **Biometric Monitoring**: Simulates and monitors the health data of crew members, including heart rate and oxygen saturation.
- **Health Recommendations**: Provides recommendations for crew members based on their health data.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Sends alerts when critical system states are detected, including low oxygen or water levels.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - twilio (for alerts and notifications)
